## Hi there!👋 I'm Nadia, a Product Designer.
I enjoy using human-centered design principles to cultivate conversation, connection, and understanding. My priority is always empathy, as I strive to create space for even those with the smallest of voices to be heard.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing my design portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and front-end web development.
- 💃🏽 Fun fact: I'm a dance teacher! My love for dance is lifelong.
